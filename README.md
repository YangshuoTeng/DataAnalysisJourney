## 🏡 Project 1: Toronto Airbnb Analysis

For my first project, I created an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** using Airbnb data from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). The goal was to analyze how **listing prices** vary by **number of bedrooms** and **neighborhoods** in Toronto.

### 📊 Visualizations Included

#### 1. Average Price by Number of Bedrooms *(Top-Left)*
- Calculated the average price for each bedroom count.
- Surprising insight: listings with **5 bedrooms** had the highest average prices, but prices declined for listings beyond 5 bedrooms.
- This challenged my assumption that more bedrooms always mean a higher price.

#### 2. Room Availability by Bedroom Count *(Top-Right)*
- Showed how many listings exist for each bedroom count.
- Most common: **1-bedroom listings**, followed by 2 and 3.
- Listings with 0 bedrooms were usually **studio apartments**.

#### 3. Average Price by Neighborhood *(Bottom)*
- Mapped average listing prices across Toronto neighborhoods.
- **Scarborough Village** stood out with the highest average price — likely due to its waterfront location.

### 🎯 Project Purpose

This dashboard helped me make data-informed decisions for my **upcoming vacation in Toronto**. With it, I can:

- Understand price trends across neighborhoods
- Compare options by bedroom count
- Set a realistic travel budget

However, **price isn't everything** — I also want to factor in **safety** when deciding where to stay.
